So you’ve stumbled across my little part of the world wide web, pretty neat, eh? Majority of the posts you’ll see on here revolve somewhat around task automation through shell scripting. Nothing too complex, and anyone with a background in scripting and UNIX should be able to pick it up, modify, and reuse for their own purpose.

You’ll also quickly realise that most posts will revolve around the AIX operating system, and the software that runs on it.

If you’d like to reach out to me, the easiest way would be via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Kristijan){:target="_blank"}.

Happy reading.
